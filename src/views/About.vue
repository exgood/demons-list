          What is this and why is here? This is a good question. I needed a
          visible list with all 72 Goetia spirits. The idea was they all to be
          visible. I didn't find such thing and I did it. If you need such thing
          you can use this page on a big monitor. My work with this thing is
          finished. I am just leave it here if someone has need of something
          similar in the future? If you like this thing and want to communicate
          with me find my email and write me.
